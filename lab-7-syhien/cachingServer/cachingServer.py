''' Caching Server for Content Delivery Network (CDN)

CachingServer is a subclass of TCPServer that runs a server.
CachingServerHttpHandler is a subclass of BaseHTTPRequestHandler that handles
HTTP reqeust.

There is a CacheTable in CachingServer to store CDN caches.
CachingServer is also responsible for fetching content from remote main server.

If the target content does not exist in the server cache, the server should
fetch it from remote main server and store it in local cache for future usage.
Else the server shall just response with the cache content.

For optional task 2, we need to consider large content delivery. When we fetch
a large content from remote, storing it locally before replying back to client
is not acceptable, since the client will wait for a long time. So the server
shall store and response to client simultaneously.

    An HTTP request or response should have a head and an optional body.
    
    The request head will be parsed automatically in BaseHTTPRequestHandler.
    The path in URL will be stored in self.path. It will call self.do_GET() or
    self.do_HEAD() according to the request's method. You can simply consider
    one of them the entry of the handler.
    
    The response head is consist of status, version and multiple headers. At
    least it should have headers "Content-Type" and "Content-Length". The
    former is the type of the content to send and the latter is how many bytes
    the content has. Also the BaseHTTPRequestHandler provides some useful
    methods to create the headers.

    There are two io.BufferedIOBase readable and writable objects, self.rfile
    and self.wfile. self.rfile is used to read bytes from the client and
    self.wfile is used to write bytes to the client.
